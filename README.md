# POSP
> Propose open source project

<br/>
This is going to be website where other github users can propose solution or add request for needed tool
<br/>
But they don't have time to write code (solution) for it.
<br/>
It can be only problem that they would like to solve or even whole draft (that depends on writer).
<br/>
Others can update/add to existing proposal.
<br/>
It should have system to link proposals as duplicates and to somehow merge them (?), and to link existing solutions for mentioned problem.
